This is the dashboard that I use to interact with the API that makes my personal website run.

Using this dashboard, I'm able to login, add and edit blog posts, projects, and more (see screenshots below).

I decided to use React and Next for ease of use and speed, as well as ChakraUI for the styling part (which I didn't really push since this dashboard is only used by me).
